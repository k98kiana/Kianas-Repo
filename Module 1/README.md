# Horiseon Refactoring Project - Module 1

**Goal:** The goal of this project was to take an HTML and CSS file, and refactor them to include semantic elements.

* A majority of the lines of code used the '<div>' element to separate the different areas of the webpage: **header,** **main body,** **portion on the side (aside),** and the **footer.** Using the <div> element is unhelpful to define these sections becasue it is a **non-semantic element.** This means that it cannot be used to define the purpose of the line of code.
* Using semantic elements allows users to see what each section is supposed to represent in a line of code. For example, headers and footers of webpages can be easily labeled as <header> and <footer>, respetively.
